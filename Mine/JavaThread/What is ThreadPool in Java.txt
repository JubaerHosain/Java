A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing.

Java Thread pool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and reused many times.

In the case of a thread pool, a group of fixed-size threads is created. A thread from the thread pool is pulled out and assigned a job by the service provider. After completion of the job, the thread is contained in the thread pool again.
